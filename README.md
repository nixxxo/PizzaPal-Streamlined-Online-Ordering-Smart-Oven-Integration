### Core Values:
o What do you care about? Discuss which shared values can help guide how you approach your
work and how you collaborate with each other.



These core values serve as a foundation for building a strong and effective ICT team that not only excels in technology but also contributes positively to the organization's overall mission and objectives.
Our core values are:
-Teamwork: 
    Collaborate effectively within the team and with other departments to achieve common goals and foster a positive work environment.
-Accountability: 
    Take ownership of responsibilities, meet commitments, and be answerable for your actions and outcomes.
-Communication: 
    Foster open and clear communication within the team and with stakeholders to ensure alignment and transparency.
-Diversity and Inclusion: 
    Value diversity in the team and promote an inclusive workplace where all voices are heard and respected.
-Adaptability: 
    Be flexible and open to change, given the ever-evolving nature of technology, and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.
### Team Norms:
o How will you work? Establish a framework of ideals that you can expect each other to abide by.
(Trello, Google Drive, Teams etc.)
The comunication between the team members will be carried out verbally, when we are working on site ( Fontys R10 ).
The comunication between the team members will be carried out via a dedicated WhatsApp group in which all ideas, feedback and questions will be requested and delivered.
### Roles:
o What roles are necessary? Determine the types of roles that will keep the team focused and drive
productivity.
Team leader - oversees the whole process, is responsible for meeting the deadlines established by the team. Has a right to VETO ideas and changes to any part of the project
Developer - the main workforce behind the project. Each developed has task and responsibilities in e designated area of their expertise for this particular project. They can request and give feedback. They have to present their work and progress to the leader who has to approve the progress or send the developer back to work on their tasks 
### Metrics of Success:
o What does success look like to you? Consider how success can be measured beyond a letter grade
or score.
Success can and should be measured based on percieved ability before the project is done (which determines how difficult the project actually is for the team members) 
Time is an essential metric of success. The quicker the project is done the more successful the team has been in tearms of time efficiency.
### Standards of Quality:
o What are your standards for high quality work? Think about the level of quality you deliver and
expect from your teammates.
